### The Dreamy Raspberry Pi Photobooth

This is a project whose goal is to combine a Raspberry Pi Photobooth with Google Deep Dream image library.

[Google Deep Dream](https://github.com/google/deepdream) is a neural network library to do weird things with photos.

The core steps for a raspberry pi photobooth come from [MAKE magazine's photbooth article](http://makezine.com/projects/raspberry-pi-photo-booth/).

Following [Knight of pi](http://www.knight-of-pi.org) setup steps for the google deep dream on the raspberry pi:
